# Object-detection-using-CNN.
This project is coded in python . The project is on  Object Detection Using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) on CIFAR-10 dataset.  The project  contains 4 python file load.py, model.py, train.py and test.py. The Cifar-10 dataset contains two set of data first for training set and  another for test set. Load.py: Its loads the pixel values and the image associated  with it into numpy array. Model.py: Here, we have created  the model. Using TfLearn API we have implemented CNN and other layers. Train.py:In this file, we have trained the model by training dataset of the CIFAR-10 dataset. here we had to define model specifiactions:Width, Height,Learning Rate,Epochs, Model name. Test.py:Here, we have give image as input and resize it and pass it to predict function to get possible output of the that image.
